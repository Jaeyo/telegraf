# Graphite

The Graphite data format translates graphite _dot_ buckets directly into
telegraf measurement names, with a single value field, and without any tags.
By default, the separator is left as ".", but this can be changed using the
"separator" argument. For more advanced options,
Telegraf supports specifying "templates" to translate
graphite buckets into Telegraf metrics.

### Configuration

```toml
[[inputs.exec]]
  ## Commands array
  commands = ["/tmp/test.sh", "/usr/bin/mycollector --foo=bar"]

  ## measurement name suffix (for separating different commands)
  name_suffix = "_mycollector"

  ## Data format to consume.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
  data_format = "graphite"

  ## This string will be used to join the matched values.
  separator = "_"

  ## Each template line requires a template pattern. It can have an optional
  ## filter before the template and separated by spaces. It can also have optional extra
  ## tags following the template. Multiple tags should be separated by commas and no spaces
  ## similar to the line protocol format. There can be only one default template.
  ## Templates support below format:
  ## 1. filter + template
  ## 2. filter + template + extra tag(s)
  ## 3. filter + template with field key
  ## 4. default template
  templates = [
    "*.app env.service.resource.measurement",
    "stats.* .host.measurement* region=eu-east,agent=sensu",
    "stats2.* .host.measurement.field",
    "measurement*"
  ]
```

#### Templates

Templates are of the form:

```
"host.mytag.mytag.measurement.measurement.field*"
```

Where the following keywords exist:

1. `measurement`: specifies that this section of the graphite bucket corresponds
to the measurement name. This can be specified multiple times.
2. `field`: specifies that this section of the graphite bucket corresponds
to the field name. This can be specified multiple times.
3. `measurement*`: specifies that all remaining elements of the graphite bucket
correspond to the measurement name.
4. `field*`: specifies that all remaining elements of the graphite bucket
correspond to the field name.

Any part of the template that is not a keyword is treated as a tag key. This
can also be specified multiple times.

NOTE: `field*` cannot be used in conjunction with `measurement*`!

#### Measurement & Tag Templates:

The most basic template is to specify a single transformation to apply to all
incoming metrics. So the following template:

```toml
templates = [
    "region.region.measurement*"
]
```

would result in the following Graphite -> Telegraf transformation.

```
us.west.cpu.load 100
=> cpu.load,region=us.west value=100
```

Multiple templates can also be specified, but these should be differentiated
using _filters_ (see below for more details)

```toml
templates = [
    "*.*.* region.region.measurement", # <- all 3-part measurements will match this one.
    "*.*.*.* region.region.host.measurement", # <- all 4-part measurements will match this one.
]
```

#### Field Templates:

The field keyword tells Telegraf to give the metric that field name.
So the following template:

```toml
separator = "_"
templates = [
    "measurement.measurement.field.field.region"
]
```

would result in the following Graphite -> Telegraf transformation.

```
cpu.usage.idle.percent.eu-east 100
=> cpu_usage,region=eu-east idle_percent=100
```

The field key can also be derived from all remaining elements of the graphite
bucket by specifying `field*`:

```toml
separator = "_"
templates = [
    "measurement.measurement.region.field*"
]
```

which would result in the following Graphite -> Telegraf transformation.

```
cpu.usage.eu-east.idle.percentage 100
=> cpu_usage,region=eu-east idle_percentage=100
```

#### Filter Templates:

Users can also filter the template(s) to use based on the name of the bucket,
using glob matching, like so:

```toml
templates = [
    "cpu.* measurement.measurement.region",
    "mem.* measurement.measurement.host"
]
```

which would result in the following transformation:

```
cpu.load.eu-east 100
=> cpu_load,region=eu-east value=100

mem.cached.localhost 256
=> mem_cached,host=localhost value=256
```

#### Adding Tags:

Additional tags can be added to a metric that don't exist on the received metric.
You can add additional tags by specifying them after the pattern.
Tags have the same format as the line protocol.
Multiple tags are separated by commas.

```toml
templates = [
    "measurement.measurement.field.region datacenter=1a"
]
```

would result in the following Graphite -> Telegraf transformation.

```
cpu.usage.idle.eu-east 100
=> cpu_usage,region=eu-east,datacenter=1a idle=100
```

There are many more options available,
